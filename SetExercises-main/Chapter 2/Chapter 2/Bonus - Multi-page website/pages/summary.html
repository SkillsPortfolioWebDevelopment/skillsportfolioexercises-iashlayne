    <p>
        A paraplegic Marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission becomes torn between following his orders
        and
        protecting the world he feels is his home.
    </p>
    <p>
        When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on
        the
        distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of
        driving off
        the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland.
        In
        exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers knowledge, of the Indigenous Race and their
        Culture, for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously
        attempting to
        infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. While Jake begins to bond with the native
        tribe and
        quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless
        extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of
        Pandora.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but are highly evolved. Because
        the
        planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for
        free
        movement on Pandora. Jake Sully, a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and
        falls in
        love with a Na'vi woman. As a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Earth, 2154. As part of the ambitious Avatar Program, a project created to explore the hostile environment of
        Earth-like
        exomoon Pandora, Jake Sully, a 22-year-old paraplegic Marine veteran, arrives on the mysterious planet. As Sully
        learns
        to control his advanced bio-engineered avatar to infiltrate the indigenous Omatikaya clan, a race of sapient
        humanoids
        dwelling in Pandora's lush jungles, he undertakes a dangerous mission: build bridges between humans and the
        blue-skinned, peace-loving Na'vi giants. Sinister forces, however, threaten the verdant extrasolar planet with
        ulterior
        motives. Now, torn between two worlds, the earthling in an alien body must pick sides. Can Sully win the
        natives' trust
        and help protect the virgin green haven?
