            <br><br>Spellbinding!

            <br><br>We have here a science-fiction epic set on an alien world. It's a classic story of a "good-guy" hero
            who
            must overcome a
            battle within himself to do what is right.

            <br><br>Although the movie doesn't exactly have the biggest twists, turns, or surprises, it simply sets out
            to
            do
            what movies
            like "Star Wars" (the ones in the 70s, and 80s, that is) did... to stun us a little with the latest in
            special FX, give
            us a classic "Romanesque" story, and enchant us with a very creative world. This movie did what it set out
            to do,
            perfectly... and maybe even a little better than perfect.

            <br><br>The world is so detailed, and rich. Every animal looks as if it is real... and everything just
            matches
            and
            seems
            convincing. The "humanoid" race that inhabits this world is very interesting, and the way the world works
            "together" is
            amazing. This may be one of the few sci-fi adventure movies where the computer animation actually works in
            favor of the
            storyline. Animals and beings do not look like animations. This realism, this pushing of the limits, is what
            science
            fiction is all about.Avatar is James Cameron's child in waiting for longer than a decade. Twelve years since
            Titanic
            Cameron again delivers with a great science fiction epic with the usual tropes and clich√©s but somehow
            making it work.
            The film looks gorgeous and the planet Pandora will surely give nature pangs to many of us. It makes me
            wonder how much
            a great storyteller's skills matter- Everything and everyone was against Cameron and somehow, he has managed
            to deliver.
            If you haven't seen Avatar(how?)should see it as soon as possible- this is a great science fiction adventure
            from a
            master filmmaker.Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it
            groundbreaking and a
            masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore. I find myself not completely agreeing with
            either side
            but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that
            fact that
            it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but
            it doesn't
            kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with
            the film is
            the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything
            other than
            what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this
            character and
            is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one
            can call
            derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the
            Nav'i look
            incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing
            and you feel
            the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's
            nothing
            particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the
            battle
            scenes.

            <br><br>I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured
            his
            heart
            and soul
            into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though
            similar to others)
            is like nothing I've ever seen before. The acting was by and large good; Worthington doesn't exactly shine
            as the hero,
            but he performs reasonably well.

            <br><br>But you obviously cannot have just a beautiful movie without no storyline or character to back it
            up.
            There
            is a lot of
            character in this movie. All of our human characters, the alien race, and the avatars all equally have great
            character.
            What a wonderful escape this was! It was dazzling, and even got me thinking a little about what life is
            really out there
            on the various billions of stars that make up our galaxy, and the other billions of galaxies out there.

            <br><br>Cinematic experience of the new generation!

            <br><br>8/10

            <br><br>This is unlike any kind of adventure movie my eyes have ever seen in such a long time, the
            characters, the musical score
            for every scene, the story, the beauty of the landscapes of Pandora, the rich variety and uniqueness of the
            flora and
            fauna of Pandora, the ways and cultures and language of the natives of Pandora, everything about this movie
            I am beyond
            impressed and truly captivated by. Sam Worthington is by far my favorite actor in this movie along with his
            character
            Jake Sulley, just as he was a very inspiring actor in The Shack Sam Worthington once again makes an
            unbelievable mark in
            one of the greatest and most captivating movies you'll ever see. This movie may completely turn the head of
            the old show
            of Avatar: The Last Airbender in some ways, but even I would've seen that coming even though I never watched
            the show.
            If you haven't seen this movie yet than you're missing out on something extremely astonishing and completely
            wonderful,
            it may even just change your point of view on seeing Earth and its flora and fauna and how to love and
            respect all of it
            as well as the planet itself. Take it from someone who's a complete lover and admirer of all forms of life
            on both
            Pandora when it comes to this movie and Earth and all it has to offer in reality concerning plants and
            animals. Avatar
            will amaze and astonish you more than you think both on the ground and up in the sky, this I 100%
            garuntee!!!!!

            <br><br>Normally I would never say anything publicly negative about anybody I will leave it entirely up to
            you.

            <br><br>I had purchased my tickets to see Avatar very excited about seeing a long-awaited movie couldn't
            wait was so
            in love
            with the other movie!!!

            <br><br>I read a couple of reviews about the movie from what I'm going to call narrow-minded imbeciles who
            have no
            imagination
            and obviously didn't really watch the movie just came up with a determination in their own convoluted way
            and I just
            knew but they were wrong.

            <br><br>Over 3 hour movie and I am telling you I stood almost on the end of my seat most of the time and it
            left you
            the way a
            real good movie always leaves you...wanting more

            <br><br>One of these idiots that wrote a review said it was basically like the first one but in the water
            obviously
            didn't watch
            the movie.

            <br><br>The storyline other than having similar characters had no resemblance at all in storyline what I
            enjoyed
            about it the
            most is you could really feel the timeline from when Jake started his new life and was raising his family
            obviously a
            little over a decade had passed before the human beings came back.

            <br><br>From there you get to enjoy family bonding people uniting together against common foe and realizing
            that
            there are other
            people even though they are not the same type of people they respect each other and there's nothing wrong
            with that
            ever.

            <br><br>Cinegraphically unparalleled to any movie I've ever seen it was absolutely beautiful I found myself
            hyperventilating
            quite a few times in suspense and even though they brought back some similar characters such as the foe from
            the first
            movie it is completely understandable how he came back as well as sigourney Weaver's character you have to
            really
            appreciate the imagination that went into this amazing movie!!

            <br><br>That's my take on it I hope you guys take 3 hours and see this movie I think it will be great not to
            mention
            fantastic
            popcorn LOL.

            <br><br>It also definitely left the story open a lot of questions not answered but that's all part of a
            great movie
            and a great
            sequel it will definitely be even better as the story continues!
