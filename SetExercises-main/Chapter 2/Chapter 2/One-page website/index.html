        When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on
        the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of
        driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their

        On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear primitive but are highly evolved. Because
        the
        planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for
        free
        movement on Pandora. Jake Sully, a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and
        falls in
        love with a Na'vi woman. As a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Earth, 2154. As part of the ambitious Avatar Program, a project created to explore the hostile environment of
        Earth-like
        exomoon Pandora, Jake Sully, a 22-year-old paraplegic Marine veteran, arrives on the mysterious planet. As Sully
        learns
        to control his advanced bio-engineered avatar to infiltrate the indigenous Omatikaya clan, a race of sapient
        humanoids
        dwelling in Pandora's lush jungles, he undertakes a dangerous mission: build bridges between humans and the
        blue-skinned, peace-loving Na'vi giants. Sinister forces, however, threaten the verdant extrasolar planet with
        ulterior
        motives. Now, torn between two worlds, the earthling in an alien body must pick sides. Can Sully win the
        natives' trust
        and help protect the virgin green haven?

    <h2 id="synopsis">Plot synopsis</h2>
    <p>
        The story opens with a sweeping shot high across the treeline of a lush, green rainforest. Intercut is a
        sequence of
        images of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a crippled war veteran and former Marine. He wakes up in a giant
        spaceship on
        its way to Pandora, a thickly-forested Earth-like moon orbiting Polyphemus, a giant blue planet similar to
        Jupiter. He
        is one of a large number of passengers, all waking up after almost six years of cryosleep en route to Pandora.
        Drifting
        out of his sleeping pod in zero G he's tended by the ship's staff. He opens his locker, which is marked SULLY T.
        Jake
        tells us that he has a deceased twin brother -- Tom, a scientist -- who was to be part of a high-level program
        overseen
        by corporate and military strategists to study the environment and inhabitants of Pandora. Because Jake and his
        brother
        are an exact genetic match, he was presented with a unique opportunity: take over his brother's contract with a
        corporate-military entity and travel light years away to an outpost on the previously glimpsed world, Pandora.
        Acknowledging the notions of "being free" and having a "fresh start," Jake agrees to the deal as his brother's
        body is
        cremated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now being transported from the spaceship to Pandora via a shuttle, Jake is one of many soldiers and civilian
        personnel
        about to touch down on Pandora, some 4.3 light years from Earth. We catch views of the base and its construction
        and
        immense mining machines digging up the soil in a large quarry as Jake ponders his new role. The passengers are
        all
        instructed to wear a full-face breathing mask since the atmosphere of the planet will not support human life; 20
        seconds
        of exposure to the poisonous atmosphere of the planet causes unconsciousness, with death occurring about four
        minutes
        later. While the other passengers disembark and take their first steps onto the base, called "Hell's Gate,"
        which is
        surrounded by a huge perimeter fence, Jake follows them in his wheelchair, earning the moniker "Meals on Wheels"
        from a
        few haughty Marines. He acknowledges through voice-over that he lost the use of his legs during one of his tours
        of duty
        on Earth, and while a spinal injury like his can be fixed it "takes money," which is tough to come by in the
        present
        economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake goes immediately to a military briefing where Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is addressing the
        assembled
        soldiers and a few civilians who have come along. He reminds them they're "not in Kansas any more," and he tells
        them
        about Pandora's indigenous population, the Na'vi. Quaritch, sporting a heavy set of scars on the side of his
        head, says
        they are "hard to kill" and practically everything "out there" will try to kill you. And, while it's his job to
        keep his
        people alive, he says he will not succeed in this task -- "not with all of you." If they wish to survive, he
        continues,
        they will have to follow "Pandora rules."
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake goes to a science lab where he meets biologist Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) and Dr. Max Patel (Dileep
        Rao), two
        members of the Avatar Program. As Jake gets his first look at his own avatar, we learn about the program itself:
        humans
        are unable to breathe Pandora's air, but the Avatar Program enables a human to link with their own avatar, a
        genetically-bred human-Na'vi hybrid, and function as if they were a Na'vi native. In his avatar body, Jake will
        be able
        to walk again and breathe the atmosphere. The avatars look very much like their human "drivers". When Norm tells
        Jake
        his avatar looks like him, Jake profoundly says it looks like his dead brother.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake and Norm enter the science department just about the time Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), the
        program's
        science lead, awakens in a specially designed pod that links her to her avatar and flips open the top. Norm says
        to Jake
        he hears she likes "plants better than people." She arises from her pod and converses in Na'vi with Norm.
        Satisfied with
        Norm's command of the language, she turns to Jake. She tells him she needs his brother Tom, the PhD who trained
        3 years
        for the Pandora mission, but she doesn't need Jake since Jake has no lab experience and has never been linked to
        an
        avatar. Jake tries to imply that he's a quick learner but the ill-tempered Grace isn't impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grace storms off to the base's control room to confront Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), base commander and
        representative for the Resources Development Administration (RDA), an corporation that oversees all military and
        other
        personnel on the colony. He tells her Jake will serve as a security escort on her team while they're on the
        planet's
        surface. Grace tells Parker she needs a researcher, not a "jarhead dropout." She doubts Jake will be of any use
        to her
        botanical research. Parker replies, saying he disagrees, saying they "lucked out" with Jake. Since he's a
        perfect
        genetic match for the avatar intended for his twin brother, they can use his military skills in an avatar body
        toward
        the overall objective of the operation -- mining the mineral unobtanium, a potent source of energy that sells
        for many
        millions a kilo, and can bring cheap power back to a dying Earth. Parker tells Grace one way to help accomplish
        this
        objective is to win the hearts and minds of the natives, to obtain their cooperation. Grace argues that many of
        the
        Na'vi have been killed by the military under the auspices of Selfridge's operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back in the lab next morning, Jake and Norm are linked to their avatars for the first time. Jake, in his avatar,
        wakes
        up in a different room with other avatars and staff. Within a few moments, Jake is making his handlers nervous
        because,
        overjoyed with his ability to move his legs again, he is moving too quickly and trying to walk, the first time
        he has
        been able to do so since becoming a paraplegic. The human lab workers cannot stop him; a Na'vi is over 10 feet
        tall,
        sometimes closer to 12 feet, and far stronger than humans. When his long tail knocks over instruments, a staff
        member
        tells him to stop and lie down again. Jake ignores him and bursts out of the room and into the daylight. He
        finds
        himself in a recreation area where other avatars are playing sports and staff, in their protective gear, are
        performing
        various duties. Jake meets Grace's avatar, who, better-tempered than human Grace, accompanies Jake to the
        barracks where
        he is eventually encouraged to rest. Before he lies down to sleep, Jake inspects his neural queue, a long
        appendage that
        looks like a braid of hair. At the end of his queue is a cluster of hidden tendrils. When the avatar sleeps, the
        link is
        broken and Jake himself awakens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake later meets Trudy Chacon (Michelle Rodriguez), a retired Marine pilot with whom he'll spend several weeks
        getting
        used to his avatar and exploring Pandora. Jake will serve as the door gunner on her crew.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake meets with Col. Quaritch, who is lifting weights. The Colonel tells Jake he's looked up his service record
        and was
        impressed with what he accomplished on some of his tours, including one in Venezuela. The Colonel warns Jake
        about the
        dangers awaiting him on Pandora. He also states his belief that the Avatar Program is a joke but that it offers
        an
        opportunity for a unique reconnaissance mission: If Jake can find out and tell the Colonel what he wants to know
        about
        the natives (how to persuade them to move away from the unobtanium ore deposits and how to hit them hard if they
        won't),
        the Colonel will see to it that Jake gets the surgery he needs to regain use of his legs. The Colonel climbs
        into an AMP
        suit -- a bipedal exoskeleton used for missions on Pandora -- and moves off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Relinked with his avatar, Jake flies over Pandora's surface in Trudy's gunship, along with Grace, Norm, and
        others. The
        team lands in a forest, where Grace and Norm begin to take samples of the flora and make measurements. Jake is
        distracted by his surroundings and wanders into a field of helicoradian flowers, which are quite tall and shrink
        at
        Jake's touch. Trouble arrives when a titanothere -- a heavily-armored, hammerheaded creature -- confronts Jake.
        Grace
        orders him to stand his ground and not shoot, or else the animal will get angry and charge. His armor is too
        thick for
        guns to have any effect anyway. Jake successfully holds his ground, but only because another beast, a
        panther-like
        thanator, has approached him from behind and has caused the titanotheres to retreat and surround their young.
        The
        thanator then turns to Jake. Grace tells him to run, and he's pursued by the thanator in a chase that separates
        Jake
        from his crew. He loses his gun and is downed by the animal, but frees himself by releasing his backpack.
        Ultimately,
        the chase leads to a waterfall, where Jake jumps to safety, leaving the thanator roaring above him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake's crew searches for him but Trudy says they'll have to return to base since night ops are not allowed.
        Grace says
        he won't last the night.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's now night and we see Jake sharpening a long stick into a spear Jake is being watched from above, this time
        by a
        Na'vi. The Na'vi aims an arrow at Jake and is about to shoot, but decides against it when small, ethereal,
        luminescent
        creatures land on her bow. (Later we learn they are "very pure spirits," also known as the "seeds of Eywa", the
        Na'vis
        all-powerful god.) The archer retreats. Jake is stalked by a pack of viperwolves. He dips the end of his spear
        into a
        combustible pitch-like liquid. He lights the end and uses it as a a torch against the viperwolves, who encircle
        him,
        teeth bared, jaws gnashing. The animals attack Jake; he fights back, kills some, and is taken down by others.
        The archer
        who was observing Jake joins the battle on his side. She kills some viperwolves and causes the rest to flee. She
        tenderly puts out of their misery some whimpering wounded animals and says prayers over them. Jake attempts to
        thank her
        for helping him fight off the attackers. She meets his thanks with scorn, tells him all this is his fault, that
        they did
        not need to die, and that he should "go back" to where he came from. Jake asks if she feels that way, why she
        helped
        him. "You have a strong heart. No fear," she explains. "But stupid!"
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake attempts to follow his rescuer up into a tree, asks for her help, and says he wants to learn. He's repulsed
        and
        told to "go back," that sky people can't be taught. Just then, the seeds of Eywa reappear and start to land on
        the
        nervous Jake. He asks what they are. "Very pure spirits," she replies, and Jake is covered by them, making an
        impression
        on his companion. When the seeds drift off, she relents and tells him to come with her.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Jake tries to keep up with his rescuer, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), he is felled by a bolo thrown by a patrol of
        Omaticayan warriors. Their leader is Tsu'Tey (Laz Alonso), next in line to the throne and the man Neytiri is
        expected to
        marry. Neytiri stops them from harming Jake by telling them "there has been a sign from Eywa." Tsu'Tey tells his
        men
        to
        "bring him" along to "tashik" (father, approximate spelling) and "eywa" (mother).
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake is presented to Neytiri's parents, Eytukan (Wes Studi) and Mo'at (CCH Pounder), who are the king and queen
        of
        the
        tribe, respectively. Jake tells the elders that he is a warrior -- a "dreamwalker" -- and his intention is to
        learn
        from
        them. Mo'at pricks Jake's chest and tastes his blood, decreeing it is the will of Eywa for him to live with the
        Omaticaya, and for Neytiri, however reluctantly, to be his teacher in their ways and customs. After a ritual
        gathering,
        Jake is brought to his bed, a leaf high up in the "Hometree" that encircles him like a cocoon. As he falls
        asleep,
        human
        Jake is revived.
    </p>
    <p>
        At morning chow, all the scientists, including Grace, are focused on everything Jake has to say. Norm seems very
        disappointed and sullen; he was Grace's original choice to bond with the Omaticaya. Even the military and
        corporate
        reps
        have warmed to Jake. Hometree sits atop a massive deposit of unobtanium so Jake appears to be their best shot at
        convincing the Omaticaya to move -- or advising the Colonel on how to force them to do so. He's informed that he
        has
        three months to achieve his objective before the bulldozers arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next scenes revolve around avatar Jake's training with Neytiri and human Jake's reports on his experiences
        via
        the
        videolog he dictates after every day's activity. He bonds with his direhorse, an important animal to the Na'vi.
        Jake
        must learn to mount the animal and connect his neural queue to its antenna. Human Jake continues to report on
        the
        Hometree's infrastructure and other Na'vi details. Jake has a difficult time learning how to control his
        direhorse
        and
        is often referred to as "skxawng" ("skown") by Neytiri and Tsu'tey, which he tells us means "moron."
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake reports back to the Colonel and Selfridge about the Omaticaya's home, the giant Hometree. Underneath it is
        a
        large
        deposit of unobtanium. Jake tells them about the structure of the 1000 foot tall tree. Quaritch sees an
        opportunity
        to
        destroy the tree but Jake request he be allowed to negotiate with the Na'vi and convince them to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sensing that Jake is being manipulated by Quaritch, Selfridge and the rest of the military section of the mining
        operation, Grace decides to take her operation "out of Dodge." She moves them into the Hallelujah Mountains, a
        remote
        region of immense, floating islands that are sacred to the Na'vi and are also rich in unobtanium. Grace wants
        her
        turf
        away from the RDA officials and military types at the base.
    </p>
    <p>
        In his next videolog, Jake discusses his language lessons and says his time with the Na'vi is like
        "field-stripping
        a
        weapon." Enough repetition and you can't help but learn it. This is intercut with scenes of his continued
        training
        with
        Neytiri, who teaches him about the Na'vi-forest connection. She tells Jake that all energy is borrowed and one
        day
        we
        have to give it back. Jake seems to comprehend this, and as he says a prayer for an animal he hunted and just
        killed,
        Neytiri says that he is ready for an important rite of passage: to bond with and ride a "declan" -- a flying
        mountain
        banshee. To reach the banshee's nesting grounds, Jake must accompany Neytiri, Tsu'Tey and two other Na'vi
        trainees
        to
        the highest region of the Hallelujah Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several factors (the height, the ferocity of the untamed banshees) make this a dangerous lesson, but Jake's lack
        of
        fear
        and successful bond with his banshee earn him the grudging respect of the Na'vi warriors present, even Tsu'Tey.
        He
        makes
        the bond with the tendrils in his queue, and as he rides the flying animal he remarks that he's not much of a
        horseman
        but he was "born to do this." Jake, Neytiri, and the others ride together to the Tree of Souls, the most sacred
        place to
        the Na'vi.
    </p>
    <p>
        While flying on a hunting sortie, Jake and Neytiri are suddenly pursued and attacked by a creature known to the
        Na'vi as
        toruk, a giant and brightly-colored flying mountain banshee with murderous intentions toward everything that
        flies.
        Neytiri says its name means "last shadow" -- the toruk's shadow, once seen, is usually the "last shadow one ever
        gets to
        see," as its attack is almost always fatal. Back at Hometree, Neytiri shows Jake the skeleton of a precursor of
        the
        present toruk. She tells him the last person to ride a toruk was her grandfather's grandfather, who used the
        animal
        to
        unite the five Na'vi tribes in a time of great sorrow. Such a person would earn the title Toruk Mato, "Rider of
        the
        Last
        Shadow."
    </p>
    <p>
        When Jake comes back to his human form, it's clear he's been changed by this latest experience, for he says,
        "out
        there
        is the real world ... in here is the dream." The Colonel comes over to him to tell him his mission is
        accomplished
        and
        he's to return to Earth that day. And good to his word, the Colonel has arranged for Jake to get the treatment
        he
        needs
        to regain use of his legs. Jake wishes to delay his departure because he says he's right at the point at which
        he's
        to
        be initiated into the tribe and accepted as one of them, and then would have the status to negotiate with the
        Na'vi
        to
        relocate. The Colonel acquiesces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake attends a Na'vi ceremony, where he learns the Na'vi believe that every person can be born twice. Neytiri
        leads
        Jake
        to a place of prayer, the "tree of voices," where they use their queues to bond with the tree. Neytiri tells
        Jake he
        can
        make a bow from the tree ... and that he can choose a woman. Jake tells Neytiri that he has already chosen her,
        and
        she
        says that she has chosen him. They sleep together under the tree and Jake wakes up back in the lab.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the morning, Neytiri awakens to falling trees, then the presence of bulldozers. Soldiers are advancing as the
        forest
        falls around Neytiri, who is dragging and carrying Jake to safety. At their remote spot, Jake is getting ready
        to
        link
        with his avatar and when he finally revives, Jake climbs onto one of the bulldozers and tries to stop it,
        eventually
        smashing its camera system and drawing some gunfire. Other Na'vi warriors arrive, while the Colonel, reviewing
        films
        back at the base, recognizes Jake in his avatar form as the person who tried to stop their mission. The
        bulldozers
        continue their operation, wiping out the sacred ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Hometree, the Na'vi want war. Grace and Jake argue against it. There's an intense debate. Tsu'Tey tries to
        kill
        Jake,
        jealous at having learned that Jake and Neytiri are mated for life when he and Neytiri were betrothed. Jake
        declares
        he
        is a Na'vi and deserves the right to speak. Suddenly, both Grace and Jake's avatars fall unconscious as the
        links
        between them and their human forms are abruptly broken by the enraged Colonel, who arrests Jake for trying to
        stop
        the
        bulldozers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grace and Jake face off with RDA and military brass. Grace reveals that Pandora's trees form a network that has
        more
        neural connections than exist in the human brain and that the Na'vi can tap into that network. Consequently, the
        Omaticaya will never leave Hometree. Parker and the Colonel discuss options. He will launch an attack on
        Hometree
        and us
        gas bombs to drive out the Na'vi. Jake presses to be allowed to return to the Omaticaya to try to convince them
        to
        leave, and he's granted one hour to achieve that objective.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake and Grace are not welcomed back. Neytiri rejects Jake. Both Jake and Grace are bound and left behind by the
        Omaticaya, who are preparing to fight against the humans, who have arrived in a large fleet of flying ships. The
        fleet
        launches gas canisters into Hometree and the surrounding area. As the battle escalates, most of the weaponry is
        targeted
        at the root structure of Hometree, which is toppled by a series of explosions and heavy artillery. Many
        Omaticaya
        are
        killed. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace and asks them to save the tribe. Jake arrives and is rejected again by
        Neytiri
        when
        he tries to console her. Neytiri's father Eytukan is killed by a large piece of shrapnel; his dying wish is for
        Neytiri
        to take his sacred bow and assume leadership of their people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The destruction seems endless, and, suddenly, Jake and Grace return to their human bodies and are promptly
        placed
        under
        arrest for treason. Norm is also arrested for trying to prevent soldiers from disabling their avatar forms. The
        Na'vi
        gather at the Tree of Souls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trudy arrives at the cell which holds Jake, Grace, and Norm. She dupes their guard by saying she wants nothing
        to do
        with them, only to knock out the guard an instant later. As they prepare to flee the base, Grace is shot and
        wounded
        by
        the Colonel. The team flies Trudy's ship to the remote lab in the floating mountains and they take a pod to
        another
        spot
        in the forest. Jake returns to his avatar body.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hopeful reunion with the Omaticaya is not to be, initially. Jake is an outcast, an alien. So he makes a bold
        decision: he realizes that to regain the trust of the Na'vi, he has to take things to a higher level. He summons
        his
        banshee and sets off to find the toruk. His strategy is simple but can easily result in death; Jake believes
        that
        the
        toruk never looks for an attack above himself and thus he can be approached that way. Jake jumps off his banshee
        and
        onto the back of the toruk. We next see him arrive riding the toruk at the Tree of Souls in the middle of an
        Omaticayan
        ceremony. Jake has successfully bonded with the toruk. The Omaticaya are stunned to see their greatest legend
        come
        true.
        Jake dismounts and makes his way through the crowd of Na'vi, who, awed, part before him. When he reaches
        Neytiri,
        each
        holds out an arm to the other and she says "I see you." Tsu'Tey, who is now tribe leader, concedes Jake's new
        role
        of
        Toruk Mato. He accords Jake much respect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake convinces Mo'at to help Grace, who is dying. Mo'at begins the preparations, which involve getting Grace's
        human
        and
        avatar bodies in place at the Tree of Souls. The idea is to permanently transfer Grace's consciousness to her
        avatar.
        Mo'at lets it be known that Grace must pass through the eye of Eywa, and that the great mother might choose to
        let
        her
        pass through to her avatar self, or she might opt to have Grace remain with her. The ritual is not successful,
        though
        before she dies, Grace tells Jake that she has seen Eywa. Jake, heartbroken and furious, speaks as Toruk Mato
        and
        says
        it's time to 'send a message' to the sky people that this is their, the Na'vi's, land. But to do so, they first
        must
        go
        to each of the Na'vi clans to ask them to come and fight as one. Tsu'tey will be the Omaticayan's new clan
        leader
        and
        will also help rally other clans to fight with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The human military have picked up the infusion of Na'vi into the area, from a few hundred to 2000 within a day.
        At
        this
        rate, the Colonel says as he addresses his troops, the Na'vi will soon total 20,000, at which point their
        perimeter
        will
        be overrun. Rather than let that happen, he continues, they must stage a pre-emptive attack while they still
        can.
        Their
        plan is to turn a space shuttle into the carrier of a massive bomb. Their target is the Tree of Souls, and the
        attack is
        planned for 0600 the next day. They believe that if they destroy the Tree of Souls, the Na'vi will go away and
        never
        come near this place again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake is busy rallying the Omaticaya. At the Tree of Souls, he uses his queue to bond with the tree and asks Eywa
        to
        look
        into Grace's memories, stressing that humankind killed their mother (Earth), the entity that protects the
        balance of
        life. Neytiri appears and tells Jake that Eywa does not take sides.
    </p>
    <p>
        Quaritch masses his fleet, mostly as protection for the Valkyrie shuttle. The bombship and the fleet move toward
        the
        Tree of Souls. The united Na'vi force begins to arrive from the sky and on the ground. Jake on his toruk,
        Tsu'Tey,
        and
        other warriors engage in battle with the military aircraft, mainly Scorpion assault ships. Casualties mount on
        both
        sides. The gunships have unmatched firepower, but are no match for the declans, who grab hold of them and smash
        them
        against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake, riding the toruk, is pursued and shot at by Col. Quaritch's Dragonfly ship; Trudy arrives and opens fire
        on
        the
        Colonel's command ship; Neytiri's banshee is shot down and killed; Norm's avatar is mortally wounded and he
        jumps
        back
        to his human form; Tsu'Tey takes on the bombship and is killed in the attempt; Trudy dies when her ship is
        destroyed
        in
        a hail of gunfire from Quaritch's Dragonfly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Neytiri watches this action from the ground. Jake attempts to contact Tsu'Tey and is unsuccessful, as is his
        attempt
        to
        reach Trudy. Meanwhile, the bombship closes in on the Tree of Souls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake tells Neytiri via communicator to disengage from the fight. Suddenly, through what's left of the
        surrounding
        forest, a battalion of Titanotheres, Pandora's heavily armored dinosaur-like animals, arrives and engages the
        Earth
        forces. They quickly lay waste to infantry and soldiers in AMP suits. Overjoyed that Eywa has heard Jake's plea
        for
        help, Neytiri rejoins the fight with many other of Pandora's species behind her. When a thanator appears nearby,
        it
        bows
        to her submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake and his toruk take to the sky to confront the bombship as the military's ground forces retreat in disarray.
        Approaching from above, Jake grenades the bombship. It crashes in flames and explosions well away from the Tree
        of
        Souls. Jake also throws explosives into vulnerable parts of the command ship. It begins to burn and go down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Col. Quaritch puts on an AMP suit and jumps free of the command ship before it disintegrates in a ball of
        flames. He
        finds himself at the temporary camp set up by Grace. In the camp, Jake is inside his avatar pod. Quaritch, set
        on
        killing Jake, is now attacked by a thanator that Neytiri had bonded with and ridden to the site. With the aid of
        his
        AMP
        suit the Colonel kills the thanator and Neytiri is trapped underneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the Colonel has a chance to kill Neytiri, Jake arrives in his avatar. The two engage in combat, the
        Colonel
        in
        his AMP suit and Jake as his avatar, armed only with a piece of pipe. Jake smashes the suit's plastic canopy,
        the
        Colonel pops it off, dons a breathing mask, and, before he moves off toward the structures that house the pods,
        asks
        Jake how it feels to have betrayed his race. "You think you're one of them? Time to wake up," he taunts, as he
        smashes
        into the mobile lab, looking for Jake's pod, intent on destroying it and human Jake. The battle resumes. Jake is
        grabbed
        by an arm of the AMP suit and hangs from his queue before the Colonel. Meanwhile, Neytiri has almost freed
        herself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Colonel now moves Jake closer to him and reaches for his knife, intending to finish Jake by slitting his
        throat.
        Suddenly, Neytiri shoots an arrow at the Colonel, impaling him through the center of his chest. The Colonel,
        reeling, is
        unable to continue his attack on Jake. Neytiri's second arrow lodges right next to the first. It brings the
        Colonel
        in
        the AMP suit to the ground. However, much damage has been done to the lab, which is leaking in the planet's
        poisonous
        atmosphere. Human Jake is awake but having difficulty both breathing and trying to get a mask on. Neytiri
        arrives
        and
        helps Jake on with his mask. Cradling human Jake, she says, "I see you." It's the first time they have seen each
        other
        face-to-face.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back at Hell's Gate, most of the remaining humans are being marched into a shuttle to be sent back to Earth;
        however, a
        select few Earth people, such as Norm and Dr. Patel, are invited to stay on Pandora.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jake signs off in his final videolog, where we learn that he has chosen to transfer his consciousness to his
        avatar
        for
        good. In a ceremony similar to Grace's, Jake passes through the eye of Eywa ... and wakes up in his avatar with
        Neytiri
        watching over him.

            3 years ago
            <br><br>Spellbinding!

            <br><br>We have here a science-fiction epic set on an alien world. It's a classic story of a "good-guy" hero
            who
            must overcome a
            battle within himself to do what is right.

            <br><br>Although the movie doesn't exactly have the biggest twists, turns, or surprises, it simply sets out
            to
            do
            what movies
            like "Star Wars" (the ones in the 70s, and 80s, that is) did... to stun us a little with the latest in
            special FX, give
            us a classic "Romanesque" story, and enchant us with a very creative world. This movie did what it set out
            to do,
            perfectly... and maybe even a little better than perfect.

            <br><br>The world is so detailed, and rich. Every animal looks as if it is real... and everything just
            matches
            and
            seems
            convincing. The "humanoid" race that inhabits this world is very interesting, and the way the world works
            "together" is
            amazing. This may be one of the few sci-fi adventure movies where the computer animation actually works in
            favor of the
            storyline. Animals and beings do not look like animations. This realism, this pushing of the limits, is what
            science
            fiction is all about.Avatar is James Cameron's child in waiting for longer than a decade. Twelve years since
            Titanic
            Cameron again delivers with a great science fiction epic with the usual tropes and clichés but somehow
            making it work.
            The film looks gorgeous and the planet Pandora will surely give nature pangs to many of us. It makes me
            wonder how much
            a great storyteller's skills matter- Everything and everyone was against Cameron and somehow, he has managed
            to deliver.
            If you haven't seen Avatar(how?)should see it as soon as possible- this is a great science fiction adventure
            from a
            master filmmaker.Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it
            groundbreaking and a
            masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore. I find myself not completely agreeing with
            either side
            but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that
            fact that
            it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but
            it doesn't
            kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with
            the film is
            the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything
            other than
            what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this
            character and
            is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one
            can call
            derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the
            Nav'i look
            incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing
            and you feel
            the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's
            nothing
            particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the
            battle
            scenes.

            <br><br>I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured
            his
            heart
            and soul
            into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though
            similar to others)
            is like nothing I've ever seen before. The acting was by and large good; Worthington doesn't exactly shine
            as the hero,
            but he performs reasonably well.

            <br><br>But you obviously cannot have just a beautiful movie without no storyline or character to back it
            up.
            There
            is a lot of
            character in this movie. All of our human characters, the alien race, and the avatars all equally have great
            character.
            What a wonderful escape this was! It was dazzling, and even got me thinking a little about what life is
            really out there
            on the various billions of stars that make up our galaxy, and the other billions of galaxies out there.

            <br><br>Cinematic experience of the new generation!

            <br><br>8/10

            2 years ago

            <br><br>This is unlike any kind of adventure movie my eyes have ever seen in such a long time, the
            characters, the musical score
            for every scene, the story, the beauty of the landscapes of Pandora, the rich variety and uniqueness of the
            flora and
            fauna of Pandora, the ways and cultures and language of the natives of Pandora, everything about this movie
            I am beyond
            impressed and truly captivated by. Sam Worthington is by far my favorite actor in this movie along with his
            character
            Jake Sulley, just as he was a very inspiring actor in The Shack Sam Worthington once again makes an
            unbelievable mark in
            one of the greatest and most captivating movies you'll ever see. This movie may completely turn the head of
            the old show
            of Avatar: The Last Airbender in some ways, but even I would've seen that coming even though I never watched
            the show.
            If you haven't seen this movie yet than you're missing out on something extremely astonishing and completely
            wonderful,
            it may even just change your point of view on seeing Earth and its flora and fauna and how to love and
            respect all of it
            as well as the planet itself. Take it from someone who's a complete lover and admirer of all forms of life
            on both
            Pandora when it comes to this movie and Earth and all it has to offer in reality concerning plants and
            animals. Avatar
            will amaze and astonish you more than you think both on the ground and up in the sky, this I 100%

            <br><br>Normally I would never say anything publicly negative about anybody I will leave it entirely up to
            you.

            <br><br>I had purchased my tickets to see Avatar very excited about seeing a long-awaited movie couldn't
            wait was so
            in love
            with the other movie!!!

            <br><br>I read a couple of reviews about the movie from what I'm going to call narrow-minded imbeciles who
            have no
            imagination
            and obviously didn't really watch the movie just came up with a determination in their own convoluted way
            and I just
            knew but they were wrong.

            <br><br>Over 3 hour movie and I am telling you I stood almost on the end of my seat most of the time and it
            left you
            the way a
            real good movie always leaves you...wanting more

            <br><br>One of these idiots that wrote a review said it was basically like the first one but in the water
            obviously
            didn't watch
            the movie.

            <br><br>The storyline other than having similar characters had no resemblance at all in storyline what I
            enjoyed
            about it the
            most is you could really feel the timeline from when Jake started his new life and was raising his family
            obviously a
            little over a decade had passed before the human beings came back.

            <br><br>From there you get to enjoy family bonding people uniting together against common foe and realizing
            that
            there are other
            people even though they are not the same type of people they respect each other and there's nothing wrong
            with that
            ever.

            <br><br>Cinegraphically unparalleled to any movie I've ever seen it was absolutely beautiful I found myself
            hyperventilating
            quite a few times in suspense and even though they brought back some similar characters such as the foe from
            the first
            movie it is completely understandable how he came back as well as sigourney Weaver's character you have to
            really
            appreciate the imagination that went into this amazing movie!!

            <br><br>That's my take on it I hope you guys take 3 hours and see this movie I think it will be great not to
            mention
            fantastic
            popcorn LOL.

            <br><br>It also definitely left the story open a lot of questions not answered but that's all part of a
            great movie
            and a great
            sequel it will definitely be even better as the story continues!
            <br><br>10/10
