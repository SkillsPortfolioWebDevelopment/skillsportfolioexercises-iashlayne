    <p>A paraplegic Marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission becomes torn between following his orders

    <p>
        When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on
        the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of
        driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their
        rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers knowledge, of the
        Indigenous Race and their Culture, for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch,
        while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. While Jake
        begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless
        Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight
        back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.
